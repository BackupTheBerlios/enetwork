CService SQL Cache.
- If possible try to implement this with templates or in such a way that it can be used by other modules.
- Sql Objects Cache. 1 std::map<unsigned int (id), SqlObject> 1 std::multimap<unsigned int (hits), SqlObject>
  - Maybe use mysql++ SqlObjects and hold an instance of them in local objects for easy extraction of data.?
  - How long is the max amount of time data can be in the cache before it can be deleted? Is this necessary?
  - How long and how to check for data that shouldn't be in cache anymore? (delete data that hasn't been getting hits off cache).

- Check issue with Crypto::MatchPassword().
- Log how many bytes were sent to OutBuffer.
- Test DelServer fix.
- Imeplement the channel service bot.
- Msgs to implement in the following order: (these are not really needed until we start working on the oper service bot)
  - JUPE
  - GLINE
- FULLY test Network base.
- Comment the code as needed.
- Write an API documentation.
