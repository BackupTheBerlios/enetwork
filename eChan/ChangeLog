October 31st, 2003 - clsk - Started working on eChan.
  * Started the Socket class. still need to finish SocketException class.

November 1st, 2003 - clsk - eChan Connects to the network.
  * Made Client and Server struct.
  * The pseudo-server is always Servers.begin() and channel service bot is always Servers.begin().
  * Finished the SocketException class.
  * orginized the main function. Organized try/catch blocks.
  * fixed the debug class.
  * Started and almost finished Servers class. Still need to finish it.

November 2nd, 2003 - clsk - Finished Clients and Servers class. (This took me the whole day!!!)
  * Finished working on Servers.
  * Now each Server has a list of ClientIterator(s). Now when you destroy a server the clients on that server are
    destroyed as well automatically.
  * Added the software license. Using GNU GPL. All (current) files are copyrighted to me (Alan Alvarez).

November 3rd, 2003 - clsk - Fixed some stuff in Clients and Servers class.
  * Added Account member to Client struct.
  * Re-organized Contructor parameters for Client and Server structs.
  * Added AddModesToClient and DelModeToClients methods to Clients class.

November 4th, 2003 - clsk - Started Channel struct.
  * Added a AddModes and a DelModes member to Client struct.
  * Started working on Channel struct. Still need to work some
    things out about how the Channels class is going to work.

November 6th, 2003 - clsk - Almost finished Channel struct, ChanneClient struct and Channels class.
  * Worked alot on Channel struct, ChanneClient struct and Channels class.
  * still need to fix a bug on Channel::AddClient().

November 7th, 2003 - clsk - Some progress in Channels.
  * Fixed some bugs on Channels structs/class.
  * There is still a bug. For some reason the Modes is "magically" emptied.

November 8th, 2003 - clsk - Finished Channels base.
  * Fixed bugs on Channels base.
  * Now when a client is destroyed it is removed from all channels.
  * Also now when a channel becomes empty the channel is destroyed.
  * Added BanList to channels.
  * Clients, Channels and Servers base are finished. Next step is the Message Parser. 
  * Fixed debug class.
  * Fixed IsCommand and made inbuffer static.
  * Added Flag member to Server struct.

Decemeber 6th, 2003 - clsk - re-wrote network base.
  * Now the network base is represented by the Network class.
  * everything is now in the namespace eNetworks.
  * the project was accepted today in developer.berlios.de.
  * implemented the Msg class and the parser. For now only PreServerMsg works.
  * Made MsgTokenizer class.
  * Alot of changes have been made that I can't remember atm.

December 7th, 2003 - clsk - Added Msg_S class (Token S) handler.
  * Added Msg_S class to handle S tokens and add servers in the network database.
  * Tokens with ':' prefix in MsgTokenizer now doesn't include the prefix ':'.
  * Removed all warnings even when compiling with -W and -Wall

December 8th, 2003 - clsk - Added Msg_N class (Token N) handler.
  * Added Msg_N class to handle N tokens and add clients in the network database.
  * Added Tokens::ERROR handler. Still need to check for ERROR tokens coming from a defined source.

December 11th, 2003 - clsk - Added Msg_B class (Token B) handler.
  * Added Msg_B class to handle B tokens and add channels in the network database.
  * Organized Msg derived classes files. Now each class has its own source file.
  * MsgParser is now a static member of Msg.
  * Fixed a bug in Msg constructor where if the source of the message happened to have the same letters 
    as the token the Parameters wouldn't work as expected.

December 12th, 2003 - clsk - Made Makefiles and Added Msg_EB class (Token EB) handler.
  * Made a Makefile. the eChan binary now goes to bin/ and the configuration file resides there too.
  * Added Msg_EB class (Token EB) handler and sends back EA (End of acknowledgement).

December 21st, 2003 - clsk - Delete servers linked to another server when the server is deleted from the network.
  * Now the servers linked to a server are also deleted on DelClientByNumeric.
  * DelClientByName now calls DelClientByNumeric when it finds a server.
  * Commented the code in Network.cpp a little bit. Much more to comment/document.

February 17th, 2005 - clsk - Delete a channel when all clients leave.
  * Now channels are automatically deleted when all clients leave from that channel.
  * Extended Copyright notice to 2005. and also updated my e-mail address.

February 23rd, 2005 - clsk - Created Msg_C.cpp to handle C Tokens.
 * Created Msg_C.cpp to handle C messages.
 * P10Tokens.h Added Tokens::CREATE
 * now eNetwork::AddChannel uses default arguments for all its arguments except for Name and TimeStamp.

March 19th, 2005 - clsk - Created Msg_Q.cpp to hande Q Tokens
 * Created Msg_Q to handle Q Messages
 * P10Tokens.h Added Tokens::QUIT

March 19th, 2005 - clsk - Started the Buffer class.
 * New Buffer class. Still not implemented. It has no impact on software yet.
 * New User classes are InBuffer and OutBuffer.

March 25th, 2005 - clsk - Started Implementing new design.
 * Buffer classes are completed.
 * Created Mutexes and Condition Variables.
 * Created Thread class.
 * Created and(i think) finished InMsgSystem.
 * Created (and haven't finished) OutMsgSystem.
 * Need to come up with new design for the Msg Parser. (MsgParserSystem)
 * Now, in main(), we only let InMsgSystem know that there's a new message to retrieve instead of doing all that work we did before.

April 14th, 2005 - clsk - Almost done implementing Multithreading.
 * Multithreading implementation seems to be done by now. After a week of trying to find out why pthread_create died when calling it someone
   pointed out something kind of obvious that we already knew but it didn't make any sense. pthread_create's address was 0x0. What happened
   was that libpthread wasn't being linked against eChan. You'd think (as I did) that this would've produced a linker error which is why
   it didn't make any sense to even go that way. But oh well, the problem is fixed now.
 * We've got a new "bug" now and it is that as the Msg class modified it's not working as it was before and not working as expected. I'll
   take a look into that for the rest of the week and come up with fixes for that.

April 16th, 2005 - clsk - Multithreading implementation is finally done.
 * I'm finally done implementing multithreading. It's now going to go under performance test. If for some reason we find out
   that performance is better for the performance of the program not to use multithreading, it will be remoced. It shouldn't
   take any effort/time to do this. If we keep multithreading or not I have to admit it this was a good experience The design
   is also alot better.
 * Now also we're using poll() instead of select to monitor the socket file descriptor. select() was giving me a headache and this was
   not the first time this had happened. poll() is a lot easier to implement and maintain. poll() is actually the same thing. Systems
   that don't have native support for poll() normally map it to select() and vice-versa. In the future we might change to /dev/poll
   and kqueue for freebsd systems.
 * It finally is commit time again. I didn't want to commit anything until multithreading and the new design was completed.
 * There is still alot to do to give the program the design I've been planning for ever since I got back. These will be implemented
   little by little as time permits.

April 17, 2005 - clsk - Added Msg_J & Msg_L handle.
 * We now handle JOIN messages.
 * We now handle PART messages.

April 21, 2005 - clsk - Got rid of CreateLocals
 * Got rid of function CreateLocals() in tools. The procedures in that function are now done in Networks's constructor.

April 22, 2005 - clsk - Bug fixes.
 * I've fixed a few old bugs, can't remember exactly which ones at the moment.
 * Created method ClearChannels in Client class. This method takes care of deleting all channels from a user.
   Mainly used when a channel sends a join 0. Could be used for other things in the future.
 * Also created Msg_SQ. Handler for SQUIT messages.
 * Also Msg_C and Msg_L can now handle multiple channel parameters.

October 2, 2005 - clsk - Configuration File Parser.
 * Finished new Configuration File Parser (ConfigParser.cpp / ConfigParser.h).
 * New ConfigParser is much more flexible and easy to use.
 * Only difference from a user's perspective is that Configuration values are now between "'s and 
   a semicolon (';') is no longer needed to finish the "statement".

October 2, 2005 - clsk - MODE and KICK messages.
 * Finished parsing KICK and MODE messages.

October 4, 2005 - clsk - CLEARMODE message.
 * Finished parsing CLEARMODE message.
 * Also added ClearOps(), ClearVoice() and ClearBans() methods to Channel class.
