This code currently has been tested to compile in the following operating systems:

 * Linux
 * FreeBSD
 * Microsoft(r) Windows(tm) (using Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 (8.0) express).

The code should compile on many other systems as well. If you get to compile it in 
other systems you may e-mail me so I can add other operating systems to this list.

NOTE: - You will need to have mysql and mysql++ installed on your system.

        - mysql as you probably already know is a database system.
          - You will also need the mysql API header and library files.
          - If you installed mysql from a binary package you might have
            to install the mysql-dev package too.
        For more info on mysql database system please visit http://www.mysql.com.

        - mysql++ is a free c++ wrapper for MySQL's C API used to interact with
          the MySQL database server.
          - This library is released under the GPL license as this program is.

Compiling and running in Unix-like systems:
 - You should've gotten the code-base by now from cvs.
 - Run the configure script (Type ./configure).
 - type make.
 - Type make install.
 - then go to the bin directory and edit the configuration file (eChan.conf).
 - then run by typing ./eChan inside the bin directory.

Compiling and running in Microsoft Windows:
 - You're going to need Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 express and the Platform SDK. 
 - You'll also need to build mysql++. I know this is possible to do in windows.
   I might provide instructions on how to do this at a later time. Look for
   mysql++'s documentation.
 - Download the file from cvs. (I normally use TortoiseCVS for this).
 - Create a new Project from existing code.
 - set the project directory to where you downloaded the files from cvs.
 - On project properties add the include directories to directories to include.
 - Also add the include directory from the Platform SDK.
 - Add the lib directory to the linker directory dependencies.
 - Add WSock32.lib to linker dependencies.
 - Build the project.
 - modify eChan.conf
 - run eChan.exe

*** Post-Installation Notes ***
 - Make sure you add Ulines for eChan in your ircd configuration file.
 - Make sure you run the mysql scripts located at src/cservice/sql.

NOTE: eChan is still in pre-alpha state and is not mature enough for a production network.
